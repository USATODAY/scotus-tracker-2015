Alabama, a 2012 Supreme Court case that banned mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles convicted of murder, apply retroactively to those already serving life terms?", "argument_for": "Because the court has determined that children are constitutionally different from adults and cannot receive death sentences or mandatory life sentences, lawyers for Montgomery say the same should be true for those sentenced long ago as juveniles.", "argument_against": "The state says Supreme Court precedent bars retroactive application of most new criminal rules, and that applying the new standard to previously sentenced prisoners would lead to \u201cburdensome relitigation of facts buried in the past or irretrievably lost.\u201d", "quote_1": "", "quote_1_source": "", "quote_2": "", "quote_2_source": "", "outcome": "More than 2,000 people whose crimes were committed before they turned 18 could see their sentences reduced \u2013 including Henry Montgomery, who has been imprisoned more than 50 years for a murder he committed when he was 17.", "for": "", "against": "", "wildcard_or_concur_in_part": ""}, {"case_name": "Foster v.
